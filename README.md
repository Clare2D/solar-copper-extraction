# solar-copper-extraction
Scripts created to simulate the extraction of copper from chalcopyrite using solar energy

This code was written as part of the master thesis "Potential for solar thermal energy in the heap bioleaching of chalcopyrite in Chilean copper mining". 

The scripts in this repository call two external programs to solve for the system performance over a year. These include:
- TRNSYS, system simulation software
- HeapSim, a model for calculating extraction of copper from ore.

For more information about the system design, components and outcomes, refer to the paper published here: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0892687516303302
